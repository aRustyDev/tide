- Fully define the APIs for the following kinds:
  - **Kind**: `Arc`
  - **Kind**: `Sankey`
  - **Kind**: `Deployment`
  - **Kind**: `ThreatModel`
  - **Kind**: `MemoryMap`
  - **Kind**: `PermissionsMap`
- Plan out how to achieve the following features:
  - **Feat**: Client side, in browser, interactive diagram manipulation.
  - **Feat**: Client side, in browser, diagram searching.
  - **Feat**: Client side, in browser, chart filtering.
  - **Feat**: Client side, in browser, chart data representation.
  - **Feat(Diagram:MemoryMap)**: How to do overlapping boxes; they represent the shared memory regions. Will be a variation of a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) or [Euler diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram).


- Define DSLs for the different APIs defined.
